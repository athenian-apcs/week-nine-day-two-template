# Week Nine Day One: Bank Account Class

In this assignment, you'll be implementing a class to represent a bank account. In addition, you will add some code to this assignment for the homework. Please see Canvas for details on the homework.

In class, you will first add code to [BankAccount.java](src/main/java/BankAccount.java) to implement the BankAccount class. Then, you will add some code to [BankClient.java](src/main/java/BankClient.java) that allows the user to interact with their bank account. You will likely want to use Scanner to allow the user to carry out different operations!


## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [BankClient.java](src/main/java/BankClient.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```
